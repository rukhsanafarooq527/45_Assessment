// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function create_car(manufacturer: string, model: string, ...options: [string, any][]): any {
    let car: any = { manufacturer, model };
    options.forEach(([key, value]) => car[key] = value);
    return car;
}

console.log(create_car("Toyota", "Corola", ["color", "red"], ["year", 2024]));
console.log(create_car("Tesla", "Model 5", ["color", "black"], ["year", 2020]));
